1
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,500
This blade has a dark past.

2
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,300
Thank you.

6
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
So...

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
A dragon.

11
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

14
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,500
Hey, sit still.

15
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,250
Good night, Scales.

16
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

17
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,250
Scales?

18
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,500
Yeah! Come on!

19
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,000
Scales!

20
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,500
I have failed.

21
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,500
You've only failed to see...

22
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

23
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,000
You are closer than you know.

24
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,500
Scales!

25
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Scales?

26
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Scales...
